## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at [Security Advisories](https://github.com/ricardoffnunes/gopsutil/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by @ricardoffnunes and @jl-ssantos on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, vulnerability reports will be investigated and fixed or disclosed as soon as possible.
