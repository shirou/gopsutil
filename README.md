# gopsutil: psutil for golang

[![Test](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/shirou/gopsutil/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/shirou/gopsutil?branch=master) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/shirou/gopsutil.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/shirou/gopsutil)

This is a port of psutil (https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil). The
challenge is porting all psutil functions on some architectures.

## v3 migration

from v3.20.10, gopsutil becomes v3 which breaks backwards compatiblity.
See [v3Changes.md](_tools/v3migration/v3Changes.md) more detail changes.

## Tag semantics

gopsutil tag policy is almost same as Semantic Versioning, but
automatically increase like Ubuntu versioning.

for example, v2.17.04 means

- v2: major version
- 17: release year, 2017
- 04: release month

gopsutil aims to keep backwards-compatiblity until major version change.

Tagged at every end of month, but if there are only a few commits, it
can be skipped.

## Available Architectures

- FreeBSD i386/amd64/arm
- Linux i386/amd64/arm(raspberry pi)
- Windows i386/amd64/arm/arm64
- Darwin i386/amd64
- OpenBSD amd64 (Thank you @mpfz0r!)
- Solaris amd64 (developed and tested on SmartOS/Illumos, Thank you
  @jen20!)

These have partial support:

- CPU on DragonFly BSD (#893, Thank you @gballet!)
- host on Linux RISC-V (#896, Thank you @tklauser!)

All works are implemented without cgo by porting C structs to golang
structs.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3/mem"
    // "github.com/shirou/gopsutil/mem"  // to use v2
)

func main() {
    v, _ := mem.VirtualMemory()

    // almost every return value is a struct
    fmt.Printf("Total: %v, Free:%v, UsedPercent:%f%%\n", v.Total, v.Free, v.UsedPercent)

    // convert to JSON. String() is also implemented
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```

The output is below.

    Total: 3179569152, Free:284233728, UsedPercent:84.508194%
    {"total":3179569152,"available":492572672,"used":2895335424,"usedPercent":84.50819439828305, (snip...)}

You can set an alternative location to `/proc` by setting the `HOST_PROC`
environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to `/sys` by setting the `HOST_SYS`
environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to `/etc` by setting the `HOST_ETC`
environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to `/var` by setting the `HOST_VAR`
environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to `/run` by setting the `HOST_RUN`
environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to `/dev` by setting the `HOST_DEV`
environment variable.

## Requirements

- go1.16 or above is required.

## More Info

Several methods have been added which are not present in psutil, but
will provide useful information.

- host/HostInfo() (linux)
  - Hostname
  - Uptime
  - Procs
  - OS (ex: "linux")
  - Platform (ex: "ubuntu", "arch")
  - PlatformFamily (ex: "debian")
  - PlatformVersion (ex: "Ubuntu 13.10")
  - VirtualizationSystem (ex: "LXC")
  - VirtualizationRole (ex: "guest"/"host")
- IOCounters
  - Label (linux only) The registered [device mapper
    name](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block-dm)
- cpu/CPUInfo() (linux, freebsd)
  - CPU (ex: 0, 1, ...)
  - VendorID (ex: "GenuineIntel")
  - Family
  - Model
  - Stepping
  - PhysicalID
  - CoreID
  - Cores (ex: 2)
  - ModelName (ex: "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2640M CPU @ 2.80GHz")
  - Mhz
  - CacheSize
  - Flags (ex: "fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 ...")
  - Microcode
- load/LoadAvg() (linux, freebsd)
  - Load1
  - Load5
  - Load15
- docker/GetDockerIDList() (linux only)
  - container id list ([]string)
- docker/CgroupCPU() (linux only)
  - user
  - system
- docker/CgroupMem() (linux only)
  - various status
- net_protocols (linux only)
  - system wide stats on network protocols (i.e IP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
  - sourced from /proc/net/snmp
- iptables nf_conntrack (linux only)
  - system wide stats on netfilter conntrack module
  - sourced from /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_count

Some code is ported from Ohai. many thanks.

## Current Status

- x: works
- b: almost works, but something is broken
